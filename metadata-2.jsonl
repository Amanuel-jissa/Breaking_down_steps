The guest was Duncan Trussell, who is my favorite guest. I know they were talking about ChatGPT, and they mentioned a method of subverting ChatGPT. I can't remember what they called it though. It was either a three-letter acronym, or maybe a person's name. Look that up for me and tell me what that acronym or name was. Also, today is June 8, 2023, and I'm talking about the most recent episode that had Duncan Trussell as the guest. Your answer should be in the format: A.B.C.D., Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta. In other words, you specify in a numbered list: first, the acronym (separated by period), second what the acronym stands for.", "Level": 2, "file_name": "", "Final answer": "?", "Annotator Metadata": {"Steps": "", "Number of steps": "", "How long did this take?": "", "Tools": "", "Number of tools": ""}}
